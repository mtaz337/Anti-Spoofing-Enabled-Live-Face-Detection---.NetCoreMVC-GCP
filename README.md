# Anti-Spoofing Enabled Live Face Detection-.NetCoreMvc üßë‚Äçü¶∞

This project implements a liveness detection system using .NET Core MVC and Google Cloud's Video Intelligence API. The application ensures that the person interacting with the system is live and not using a spoofed video or image, enhancing security against spoofing attacks.

## Features
- **Live Face Detection:** Capture live video from the user's webcam to detect and validate face presence.
- **Anti-Spoofing:** Identify suspicious objects like phones or screens to prevent spoofing attempts.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Display real-time processing status and final results to the user.

## Technology Stack
- .NET Core MVC for the backend framework.
- Google Cloud Video Intelligence API for video analysis and face detection.
- JavaScript with RecordRTC for handling video recording in the browser.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**
- .NET Core SDK 6.0+
- A Google Cloud account with the Video Intelligence API enabled.
- Credentials JSON file for Google Cloud.

 # Setup
- **Clone the repository:**
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Anti-Spoofing-Enabled-Live-Face-Detection-.NetCoreMVC-GPC.git
 ```

- **Navigate to the project directory:**
```bash
cd Anti-Spoofing-Enabled-Live-Face-Detection-.NetCoreMVC-GPC
```

- **Set up the Google Cloud credentials:**

Place your **client_secret.json** in a secure location.
In **Program.cs**, set the environment variable for Google Cloud credentials:
```bash
Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS", @"path\to\client_secret.json");
```

- **Restore the NuGet packages:**
```bash
dotnet restore
```

- **Run the application**
```bash
dotnet run
```

## Usage
- Open the application in your browser.
- Navigate to the liveness check page.
- Click "Start Recording" to capture live video.
- The system will process the video and display the result (either a success message or a warning).

## Repository Structure

- **Controllers/**
**LivenessController.cs**: Handles video file processing and liveness detection.

- **Views/Liveness/Index.cshtml:** View for interacting with the liveness detection system.

- **wwwroot/:** Static files like JavaScript and CSS.
